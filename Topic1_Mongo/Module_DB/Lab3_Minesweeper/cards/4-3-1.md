### name
```
Iterating through Individual Cells
```
### md_content
```
We first iterate through all the cells so that we can act on each `cell`. `remaining` will be returned at the end. 
```
### code_snippet
```python
remaining = 0
for row in self:
	for cell in row:
```

### name
```
Incrementing and Decrementing
```
### md_content
```
If the cell is a mine then we want to increase the number of mines by 1. However if it is currently flagged then the user has determined it is a mine, so we should decrease our count by 1. 
```
### code_snippet
```python
            if cell.is_mine:
                remaining += 1
            if cell.is_flagged:
                remaining -= 1
	return remaining
```


Picture: mine and flag side by side

## 4-3-1 Step 3
### name

The Entire Definition
```
### md_content
```
Here is the entire `remaining_mines` function: 
````
### code_snippet
```python
@property
def remaining_mines(self):
    remaining = 0
    for row in self:
        for cell in row:
            if cell.is_mine:
                remaining += 1
            if cell.is_flagged:
                remaining -= 1
    return remaining
```
