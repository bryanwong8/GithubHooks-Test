## 6-1 Step 1

### name
Possible Mine Positions 

### md_content
```
There are two possible approaches:

* Generate a list of numbers (ex. if board is 5x5 then we would generate list of numbers from 0 to 24)
  * Then pick a random number and compute the row and col ID 
* Making the list of positions in tuple form directly and picking randomly from that list 

For our hints, we will go with the first approach.

## 6-2 Step 2
### name
```
Generating Possible Positions
```
### md_content
```
We need to generate a list of numbers. Each number should correspond to a board position and every board position should be covered.

## 6-2 Step 3
### name
```
Picking and Assigning Mine Positions
```
### md_content
```
To assign a mine, we pick a position randomly from the available positions. Then we should remove that position from the available positions so that duplicate positions do not get chosen.

## 6-2 Step 4
### name
```
Getting Row and Col ID from a Position
```
### md_content
```
For a 5x5 grid, the number positions would look like this:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><b>Col 0</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 1</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 2</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 3</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 4</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 0</b></td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 1</b></td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 2</b></td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 3</b></td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>17</td>
        <td>18</td>
        <td>19</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 4</b></td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>22</td>
        <td>23</td>
        <td>24</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Given this table I can see that the element 11 corresponds to row 2, column 1. How can you compute the row and column for any element given its number?
