For this lab, let's use what we learned about *object-oriented programming* to build a classic and nostalgic **Minesweeper** game in Python!

If you need a reminder of the rules of Minesweeper, here are the rules we are going to implement our version of Minesweeper by:

* Players will select tiles from a 10x10 grid. If a mine is clicked then the game is over. For the purposes of our game, we will have <u>10 mines</u>.

* Each non-mine tile is labelled with a number if it is adjacent (all 8 neighbors) to a mine, in which case, the number shown will be the number of mines adjacent to that tile.

  * If there are no mines adjacent, there will be a blank tile (no number) shown.

* If a tile is clicked, then there are three possibilties:

  * *The tile has no adjacent mines*: The (blank) tile and its neighbors all show. If any of the neighboring tiles are also blank, i.e. have no adjacent mines, then the neighboring tiles and their neighbors **also have to be shown**. 
    * Note: please reference the animation if this isn't clear. You will have to use recursion to complete this.
  * *The tile has adjacent mines*: The tile just shows with its number of neighboring mines.
  * *The tile is a mine*: The game is over.

* Players also have the option to flag where they think mines are located with the letter "F".
