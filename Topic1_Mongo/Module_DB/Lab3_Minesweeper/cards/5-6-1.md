## 5-6-1 Step 1

### name
```
Number of Remaining Mines
```
### md_content
```
We can use `self.remaining_mines` to compute the number of remaining mines on the board. Remember `remaining_mines` has a `@property` decorator so we can use it as a property of our `Board` object! Remember we are returning one string so we add a new line at the end for the sake of clean output.

```
### code_snippet
```python
"Mines: " + str(self.remaining_mines) + "\n  " +
```
## 5-6-1 Step 2
### name
```
Printing out Columns
```
### md_content
```
`len(self[0])` will give us the number of columns. We simply iterate through the list of 0, 1, ..., `len(self[0])` and print the string version of each number to print out the columns. Make sure to do this at the end as well. 
```
### code_snippet
```python
"".join([str(i) for i in range(len(self[0]))])
```
## 5-6-1 Step 3
### name
```
Code
```
### md_content
```
You should append row headers and row content to this string.
```
### code_snippet
```python
board_string = ("Mines: " + str(self.remaining_mines) + "\n  " +                "".join([str(i) for i in range(len(self[0]))]))
```
