## 5-4 Step 1
### name
```
show(): Obtaining the specific cell at (row_id, col_id)
```
### md_content
```
First, we have to locate the cell at `(row_id, col_id)`. How do we do that?
```
## 5-4 Step 2
### name
```
Only showing non-visible and non-flagged cells
```
### md_content
```
If a cell is visible or flagged, then we shouldn't show it. If it is not visible and not flagged then we should show it using the `Cell` class's `show()` function. 
```
## 5-4 Step 3
### name
```
Updating `is_playing`
```
### md_content
```
After the previous check, if the player shows a mine, then the game is over, so `self.is_playing` must be set to `False` in that case.
```
