## 4-2 Step 1

### name

```
What are the surrounding cells?
```
### md_content
```

We want to find all 8 of the surrounding cells given a cell's row and column. We can define a tuple or list called `SURROUNDING` that stores the 8 sets of coordinates which define the relationship between the neighbors and a cell.  
```

## 4-2 Step 2
### name
```
A SURROUNDING list?
```
### md_content
```
For example, the cell directly to the north is the cell in the same column but the previous row (-1), therefore the coordinates for the north direction are (-1, 0).
```

## 4-2 Step 3
### name
```
Using `SURROUNDING`
```
### md_content
```
For each set of coordinates in `SURROUNDING`, add them to the given row and column to generate a tuple or list of coordinates. Return that list to return the surrounding coordinates.
```
