## 5-1 Step 1

### name
```
Win Conditions
```

### md_content
```
When has the player won a game of Minesweeper? When the player has *made all non-mine cells visible* and all the *mine cells are not visible*.

### name
```

```
### md_content
```
Therefore, in our code, whenever every cell is visible or a mine, then that means our game is "solved" and we should return `True` in that scenario. Don't forget the `@property` decorator!
