## 5-5 Step 1

### name
```
Set-up
```

### md_content
```
How do we check if there are zero surrounding mines? We can use our helper `count_surrounding` to check if there are zero adjacent mines.
```

## 5-5 Step 2
### name
```
What to do
```
### md_content
```
If there are no surrounding mines then we want to show all of this tile's neighbors. Use `get_neighbors` to obtain all the neighbors of this tile. 
```

## 5-5 Step 3
### name
```
Out of bounds Handling
```

### md_content
```
Depending on how you implemented `get_neighbors` previously, you may have to run `is_in_range` on each neighbor to ensure all your neighbors actually exist within the grid. 
```
## 5-5 Step 4
### name
```
Handling Each Valid Neighbor
```
### md_content
```
Now for each valid neighbor, we want to show it on the board, so we just recursively run the `show()` function on each neighbor. Given that we want to show the cell with the surrounding coordinates in the board, which `show()` should you use: `Cell` or `Board`?
```
