## 4-3 Step 1

### name
```
Finding the cell given `self`
```

### md_content
```
Remember `self` represents the tuple of cells themselves in a 2D array. Therefore you can iterate through each row using `for row in self:` directly.
```
## 4-3 Step 2

### name
```
Using the Cell
```

### md_content
```
After finding the `row` and then iterating through the row to find each cell, you can check if a cell is a mine or if a cell is flagged using `cell.is_mine` and `cell.is_flagged`. What should you do if a cell is a mine versus if a cell is flagged? 
```
## 4-3 Step 3

### name
```
Return remaining mines
```

### md_content
```
Make sure you return the number of remaining mines (# of mines - # of flags used) when done. 
```
