Initialize the class by defining two class variables  `index` and `arr`. Note that `arr` is the `stack`, and `index` is pointing at the top of the stack, so it should be initialized to -1, since we don't have any item on the stack yet.

The function `push` will first push the item onto the stack, then increment the index, updating the location of the top of the stack.
