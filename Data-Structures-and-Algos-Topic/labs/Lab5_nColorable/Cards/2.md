The first task to designing our program is to create a function `fileReader()` that reads the user-provided CSV file which contains the adjacency matrix. The function should place the content into a 2D list structure. The CSV file should look very similar in format to the table below:

#### Sample CSV File:

0,1,0,1

1,0,1,0

0,1,0,1

1,0,1,0

As you can see, our sample CSV provides the exact same information as present in our table. Each node has its own line, and the relationship between nodes (whether they are connected or not) are separated by commas.
