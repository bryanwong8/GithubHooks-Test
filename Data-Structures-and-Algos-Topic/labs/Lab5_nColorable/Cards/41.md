Before we get into the functions that will assign the colors, it is a good idea to build a function that when given a certain vertex and color, it checks whether or not that vertex can be assigned that color. To do so, it must check whether the vertices it's connected to already have that color assignment. Try building a `checkVertex()` function. This function will allow us to implement backtracking search in `graphColoring()`.
