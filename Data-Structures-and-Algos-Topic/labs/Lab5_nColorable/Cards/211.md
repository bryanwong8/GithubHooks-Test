We must read each row in the CSV file in a for loop and separate the integer values from the commas. We then must place each row of the CSV file into our adjacency graph. Here's the code to do so.

```Python
#Open file as a csvfile
with open(filename) as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")

    # Parse through csvfile by line (which are the rows of the adjacency matrix in our case)
    for row in csvfile:
        # Make a list of ints from the current row in the csv file by splitting the numbers from the ,
        rowNums = [int(x) for x in row.split(',') if x.strip().isdigit()]
        #x.strip().isdigit() return true if all the characters in the string is digit
        #split them by ','
        # Place the list of ints we just made into our 2D list graph
        graph.append(rowNums) #put new row below previous graph to make it as an matrix
    
```

Don't forget to import the CSV package at the top of your file.

```Python
import csv
```
