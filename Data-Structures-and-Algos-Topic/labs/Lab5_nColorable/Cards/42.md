In this function, you will be using **DFS** to inspect all of the graph's vertices, and you will be using **Backtracking Search** to tell if a certain vertex does not have a valid color. If that is the case, the function will return `False` to main.

Since we want to use **Backtracking Search** in our algorithm, our `graphColoring()` function could take advantage of our previously constructed function `checkVertex()` to check if there is a valid color for the vertex currently being inspected. If there is not a valid color, `graphColoring()` should acknowledge this and return `False` so that `main()` quickly knows that the graph is not n-Colorable.

Also, don't forget to do your color assigning to vertices in the colors list. 

Note that you may find recursion helpful for this part (DFS).
