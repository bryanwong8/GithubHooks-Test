This lab will require you to use **Depth First Search** and **Backtracking Search** to solve the n-Colorable problem. Therefore, we will briefly review both of these concepts.

#### Depth First Search (DFS)

In **DFS** or **depth first search**, we start at a root node in our graph (this can be *the* root node, but also the root of any subtree), and traverse down a single branch to find our target node. If we don't find it, we traverse down the other branch. If we still don't find it, we pick one of the root's children to be the new root node and restart the process. We can perform our search in different orders just as with traversal, namely **preorder**, **inorder**, or **postorder**.

How do you think we can use **DFS** in our solution to the n-Colorable problem?

#### Backtracking Search

With **backtracking search**, we solve the problem recursively, but when a solution does not satisfy the conditions of our problem, we remove it from consideration at that point in time.  In other words, we try every single possible attempt at solution, and discard all the failures until we arrive at an answer that works.

Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.



How do you think we can apply this logic of **backtracking search** into our solution to the n-Colorable problem to quicken our process of assigning colors to vertices?

In this example, we first try left tree A. For node A, we have two options, C and D. Both of them are bad. So root A does not satisfy the solution, and we discard this solution. Root B is the counterpart of root A, and we then try node B. We also have two choices, node E and node F. Node E is good, so we find one solution, while node F is bad, which we will discard.
