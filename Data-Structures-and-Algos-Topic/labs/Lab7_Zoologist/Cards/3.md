Now that you have both the file of animals and the equations. You can determine which animal belongs to each equation by observing their end behavior and assigning a rank to each of them based on their growth rate value. End behavior is defined as what is going on at the ends of each graph (their **time complexity** or **Big O**). In this way you will have matched the equations by their animals.

Once you have matched each equation to an animal, you also know the order of the equations from smallest to largest. Use this knowledge and create an array of numbers which represent the descending order of magnitude in which the equations were given. If you have equation values `[10, 156, 20, 2]`, then you should create an array of `[3, 1, 2, 4]`, since:


* `10` is the third largest number, so it's rank is `3`,
* `156` is the largest number, so it's rank is `1`
* `20` is the second largest number, so it ranks `2`
* `2` is the smallest number, so it rank is `4`

Since this array of numbers maps with the animal names, use the dictionary and **print** out the order of animals linked to the order of equations given to confirm you stored them correctly. The order of animals printed out should match the order of the equations in the given data file.

Now we want to sort this `array` using three different sort methods: **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort** (as per lab policy D ). Edit the print statements given in the starter code to accept the `array` as an **input** and **print** out each step of a **swap** or move of the components.
