Spaces in the maze are represented with " . ". When a space(" . ") is read then the function 
`getAdjacentSpaces()` should get all neighbors of that space in a given maze. Each space will have four neighbors. These neighbors can either be walls or paths. Paths will be marked as visited or not visited. Initially all the paths will be marked not visited. 

The function `getAdjacentSpaces()` should return a list of neighbors that have not been visited. Neighbors in this case mean the possible paths one can go in the maze.


**Parameters of `getAdjacentSpaces()`**

The function will take in 3 parameters which are:

* `maze` - This is the 2D array maze

* `space` - This is a `tuple` which will contain the coordinates of the current space that we are searching on, we want to find the available adjacent spaces around this coordinate.

* `visited` - This is a `list` of all the spaces we have visited. We will use this `list` to check whether a neighbor can be found `in` this list, if so then it means that the neighbor has already been visited and thus it will not be a valid neighbor. We need to check whether a neighbor has been visited or not because we do not want to process again the spaces which we have visited. Revisiting visited spaces can create an endless cycle of searching. 


Our function should simply try to look at the surrounding spaces and see whether the spaces around it is a valid neighbor. We could do our search in a well defined order of clockwise direction, starting from looking at the neighbor in the North , then East, then South, and finally West. 

Again, the available neighbors should have these 2  conditions: 
* It is not a wall [ * ]
* It has not been visited

**Important Note**
The output of the program should check the directions in the order that was mentioned above (N,E,S,W), make sure that it does this when you submit the code.
