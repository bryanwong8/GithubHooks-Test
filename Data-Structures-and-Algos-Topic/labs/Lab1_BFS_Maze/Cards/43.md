**Step 1: check last coordinate**

Check if the last coordinate is indeed the end coordinates, and return the current path if that is the case.

Otherwise, check if the last coordinate has already been "visited", and if that is not the case, find all neighbors of the last coordinate. Then for each neighbor, add the neighbor to the current path and append that path to your data structure containing all the paths to be searched.

Add the last coordinate to your data structure containing all the visited coordinates.
