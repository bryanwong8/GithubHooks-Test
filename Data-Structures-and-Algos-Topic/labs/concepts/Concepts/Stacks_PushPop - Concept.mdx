# Adding and Removing Items onto a Stack

### Adding elements onto a stack

What makes stacks very useful is that it allows us to add and remove elements into the data structure. 

This is done with `push` command. We create a function: 

```python
def push(self, item):
    self.items.append()
```

To use this function, we can simply use the line

``` python
stack.push("Random Element 1")
```

### Removing Elements from a Stack

We can also remove elements from a stack. Similiar to adding, we need to create another function. 

``` python
def pop(self, item):
    return self.items.pop()
```

This **ALWAYS** removes the top most item in the stack. 

To use the function, we use the line:

```python
stack.pop()
```
