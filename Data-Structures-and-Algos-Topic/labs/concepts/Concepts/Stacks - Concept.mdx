   # Stacks

   A stack is a very important data structure in python. Its essentially a list of elements in python we can use to work with data. It is a linear data structure that is very flexible size and is very easy to add elements to a Stack. A stack is very similar to a Queue, although the fundamental difference is that the stack follows the **LIFO rule - Last in, first out**. 

   You can think of a stack as similar to a stack of plates. When you reach to pick up a plate, you always grab the plate closest to the top. 

   ## Stack Function

   Stacks, as a data structure, are essentially a class. We can create a Stack with the following code here. 

   ```Python
   class Stack():
       def __init__(self):
           self.items = []
   ```

   

   ### Things to remember:

   1. The topmost element provides information about the number of elements in the stack and if the stack is full or empty. 
   2. The last element to enter the stack will be the first to leave. (**Last In First Out - LIFO**). 
   3. You cannot remove elements from an empty stack. 
   4. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.
