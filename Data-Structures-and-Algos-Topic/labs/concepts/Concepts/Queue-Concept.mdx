# Queue

A stack is a very important data structure in python. Its essentially a list of elements in python we can use to work with data. It is a linear data structure that is very flexible size and is very easy to add elements to a Stack. A Queue is very similar to a stack, although the fundamental difference is that the stack follows the **FIFO rule - First in, First out**. 

You can think of a stack as similar to a stack of line for a concert. The first person to enter the line, is the first person to leave the line. 

## Queue Function

Stacks, as a data structure, are essentially a class. We can create a Stack with the following code here. 

```Python
class Queue():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
```

Just like a **Stack**, we are able to add and remove items from a queue. 

### Rules for Queue

1. Things to Remember
   1. The point of entry and exit are different in a Queue.
   2. **Enqueue** - Adding an element to a Queue
   3. **Dequeue** - Removing an element from a Queue
   4. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.
