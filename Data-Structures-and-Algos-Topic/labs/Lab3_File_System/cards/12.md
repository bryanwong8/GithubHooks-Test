<!--title={Parsing the File: Matching Storing the Name}-->

<!--badges={Python:11,Algorithms:5}-->

We can store the names of each of these files as the **value** of a node, each **node** being the unique structural number that is associated with each name. Recall in the activity that we can map the values to the nodes after we have defined the edges.

Assume that you will never have to add edges to undefined nodes.

In the activity, a dictionary was used to pass in the values to the directed graph; you should do the same.
