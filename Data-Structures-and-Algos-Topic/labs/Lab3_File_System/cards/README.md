# File System 

# Long Summary

Students will have to parse through a file that contains information about a folder/file's "structural position" within the file structure and its name. After extracting the relevant information in relation to directed graphs, they will store it in a graph that they implement themselves. Students will use the networkx library to help them visual the graph with a GUI and then write the ordered file structure to an output file using DFS.
# Short Summary

Students will understand graphs better by implementing a directed graph that represents a small file structure and printing its ordered structure in a file.

# Criteria

- The edges in these graphs have directions. Generalize what objects in the file system are the "from" objects, which are the "to" objects, and why?

- Is a graph useful if it just contains a list of nodes? Why or why not?

- When performing a DFS, what is the significance of using a queue (or in this lab's case, a queue)?
