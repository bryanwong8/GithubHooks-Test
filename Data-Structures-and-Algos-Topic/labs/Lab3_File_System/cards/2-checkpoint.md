# instruction 

Submit the all code you have completed thus far, including your `Graph` class. By now, your code should be able to read in the input files and the `Graph` class should be able to handle:

* Storing and adding edges
* Storing values (folder/file names) of each node in the graph

At the end of your main function, add the following lines of code (needed only for testing and is **NOT** part of the solution). Please note that you may need to adjust variable names depending on what you chose to name `edges` and `val_map`. This code prints out all the edges tuples and the contents of the `val_map` in a **sorted** manner:

```python
	print("Edges:")
	for edge in sorted(edges):
		print(edge)
	print("Values:")	
	for number in sorted(val_map):
		print(number, val_map[number])	
```

Submission can be done from Command-Line Interface (CLI) or through a `src.zip` file that you can drag and drop.
