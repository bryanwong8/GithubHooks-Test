To write your graph class well, it should be really easy to insert edges into the graph. Each edge has a "from" and a "to" node, making it representable by a 2 dimensional **tuple**. Because the edges are directed, the order of the elements in the tuple matters!

The first element of a tuple represents the "from" end of an arrow, while the second element represents the "to" end. Getting the directions of the arrows wrong is considered wrong when testing your code.

Now would be a great time to contemplate how the "from-to" relationship is represented in the input file and use that information to contemplate the direction of your arrows.

![Please only contemplate the directions of your edges, not your life. Existential crises are not part of this lab.](https://images.pexels.com/photos/38640/directory-traffic-note-shield-38640.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260)
