## 2-2 Step 1

### name

```
**Store values of nodes**
```

### md_content

```
In addition to storing the edges, our `Graph` class should also store the values of the nodes (the names of the folders/files).  This would greatly help in printing out the graph. Because it is important information about the graph, we want to store this as an attribute of our `Graph` class.

You will need to use a dictonary (`val_map`) to store all the nodes' information.
