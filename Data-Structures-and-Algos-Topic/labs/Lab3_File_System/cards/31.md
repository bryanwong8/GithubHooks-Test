To get the correct `pos` we need to look at how we can use the provided `hierarchy_pos()` function. 

The `hierarchy_pos()` is a function designed to make the graphs layout hierarchal (it had to be made separately because the `networkx` did not have a predefined hierarchal layout). 

We can see from the function that the first argument it needs is the graph `G`, which luckily we already have! 

However, when you look at the rest of the arguments, what do you notice? They all are already assigned values! So what else do we need to provide as an argument besides just `G` ?

Think how you can identify the root of the graph you made? If you can, just provide that as the second argument, and you'll have your `pos`.
