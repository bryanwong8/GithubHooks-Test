**Transversing through the Stack**

```
Now that we have our initial set up complete, we need to start the actual DFS traversal. Below are the general steps that you should be familiar with.

This part of the traversal is where the actual *traversing* happens. 

You are going to want to continually do these following operations until your `stack` is empty:

**Step 1: Obtain a new `start`**

**Step 2: Write the information associated with that `start` to the output file**

**Step 3: Sort the list of edges connecting to `start`**

**Step 4: Check all the edges from the given `start ` and put them on the `stack`**
```
