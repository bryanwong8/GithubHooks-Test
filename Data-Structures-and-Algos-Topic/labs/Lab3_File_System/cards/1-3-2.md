# steps

## 1-3-2 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Define `main()`**
```

### md_content

```
Depending on the nature of your program, you may not find it necessary to modularize your functions. You can feasibly do everything from a singular function. The one function you should have is the `main()` function.

You can define the `main()` function like so:
```

### code_snippet

```python
def main():
```

## 1-3-2 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: `readFile` function in `main()`**
```

### md_content

```
From there, you can run all your parsing code or you can write a separate function just for file parsing. In this setting, it is not necessary to modularize the code since we are only running the parser once, but for good practice we are going to write a separate function:
```

### code_snippet

```python
def readFile():
```

### md_content

```
We are going to pass in an empty list of edges and a empty map of values that we want it to fill with information from the file:
```

### code_snippet

```python
def readFile(edges, val_map):
```

### md_content

```
The rest of the code we have written for parsing will be inside the indented block of the method header.

You will make a choice for the rest of the functions you write. You can write them in the `main` function or you can create a separate function for them.
