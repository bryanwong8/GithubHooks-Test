This part of the traversal is where the actual *traversing* happens. 

You are going to want to continually do these following operations until your `stack` is empty:

1. obtain a new `start`
2. write that the information associated with that `start` to the output file
3. sort the list of edges connecting to `start`
4. check all the edges from the given `start ` and put them on the `stack` to go there
