In order to tell the `matplotlib` library what are graph is going to look like, we need to call the `nx.draw()` function.  Here, we provide the graph, `G`, positioning, `pos`, and let it know we don't want the labels it would assign, `with_labels=False` (i.e we want to tell it what the labels should be).

```python
    nx.draw(G, pos = pos, with_labels=False)
```

Now, we want to let `matplotlib` know what the labels of each node should be. To do this we use the `draw_networkx_labels()` function from `networkx`. Again, we provide the graph, `G`, the positioning, `pos`, and now we give our labels that are mapped to each node, `val_map`, and we specify the font size of the labeling, `4`.

```python
    nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, val_map, 4)
```

Lastly, in order to actually see the graph we use the `matplotlib` function `show()`.  Here, since we have already told `matplotlib` what we want to show, we just have to call the function:

```python
    plt.show()
```
