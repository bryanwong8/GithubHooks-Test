# instruction 

Submit all the code you have completed for the lab, including your `Graph` class and all functions. By now, your code should be able to read in the input files, use the `Graph` class to both handle edges and node values, use `networkx` functions to visually see the graph, and complete a DFS traversal of the graph and write the information of the visited nodes to an output file.

In this checkpoint, we will be testing to see if your DFS traversal is correct. Submission can be done from Command-Line Interface (CLI) or through a `src.zip` file that you can drag and drop.
