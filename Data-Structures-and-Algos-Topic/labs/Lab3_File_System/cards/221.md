In the previous easy card, we added initializing an **attribute** called `val_map` in the constructor. This attribute is of a type dictionary because it can be easily be represented as a **key-value** pair, with the key as the node and the value as the name of the folder or file.

In the previous step, when reading the file, we had already stored the nodes and their corresponding values as a dictionary, so it would be easy to add it to the graph that way.

We write a method that accepts a dictionary as a parameter:

```python
def add_val_map(self, val_map):
	self.val_map = val_map
```

And we call it like so:

```python
G2.add_val_map(val_map)
```
