In addition to storing the edges, our graph class should also store the values of the nodes (the names of the folders/files).  This would greatly help as we are printing out the graph. Because it is important information about the graph, we want to store them as an attribute of our graph class.

Think about what data structure is best for storing this kind of information: each unique node has a name that is associated with it.
