# steps

## 3-2-2 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Sort edges that connect to `start`**
```

### md_content

```
Let's now focus on sorting the list of edges connecting to `start` and implementing the functionality for adding new nodes to the `stack`.

Before we check all of the edges `start` connects to, we need to make sure that the files are in the correct order. To do this, we sort all of the edges that `start` connects to:
```

### code_snippet

```python
lst = self.edges[start]
lst.sort()
```
## 3-2-2 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Reverse the list**
```

### md_content

```
Now that the list is sorted we need to reverse the list since we are using a `stack` (Last-In First-Out):
```

### code_snippet

```python
lst = lst[::-1]
```
## 3-2-2 Step 3

### name

```
**Step 3: Iterate through the list**
```

### md_content

```
We need to loop through `lst` since it holds all of the vertices that `start` connects to:
```

### code_snippet

```python
for j in lst:
```
## 3-2-2 Step 4

### name

```
**Step 4: Check if you have visited the current vertex you are observing in the loop** 
```

### md_content

```
Again, we need to check if we have already been to the vertex we are currently observing in the loop, as we will only add the vertex to the `stack` if we have not visited it already (step 5):
```

### code_snippet

```python
if visited[j] == False: 
```
## 3-2-2 Step 5

### name

```
**Step 5: Given that you haven't visited the vertex, append it to the `stack`**
```

### md_content

```
If we haven't visited the vertex, we will add it to our `stack`:
```

### code_snippet

```python
stack.append(j)
```
## 3-2-2 Step 6

### name

```
**Step 6: Signify that you have visited the vertex**
```

### md_content

```
Now that we have pushed the vertex to the `stack`, we mark that we have visited it:
```

### code_snippet

```python
visited[j] = True
```

### md_content

```
Here is the above (and previous) code fragments shown together:
```

### code_snippet

```python
while stack:
  start = stack.pop()
  f = open("output.txt", "a")
  f.write(start+'. ' +   self.val_map[start] + '\n')
  f.close()
  lst = self.edges[start]
  lst.sort()
  lst = lst[::-1]
  for j in lst:
    if visited[j] == False: 
      stack.append(j)
      visited[j] = True
```
