# steps

## 3-2-1 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Iterate through the `stack` until it's empty**
```

### md_content

```
In order to visit all of the nodes at least once, we need to keep going until the `stack` is empty:
```

### code_snippet

```python
while stack: 
```
## 3-2-1 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Pop the last node from `stack` to visit other nodes**
```

### md_content

```
Now, we need a new vertex to visit. In order to do that, we just need to pop the last value off of the `stack` and save it in `start`:
```

### code_snippet

```python
start = stack.pop()
```
## 3-2-1 Step 3

### name

```
**Step 3: Write to a new file**
```

### md_content

```
We need to write all of the information associated with `start` to a new file:
```

### code_snippet

```python
f = open("output.txt", "a")
```
### md_content

```
The second parameter is `a` to signify that we are appending to the file.
```

## 3-2-1 Step 4

### name

```
**Step 4: Replicate the structure of the original file**
```

### md_content

```
We are now writing the correct information to the file here. `start` holds the identifier for a particular node. We know that we have the "file names" in the `val_map` so we use those as well to replicate the structure of the file we were originally given:
```

### code_snippet

```python
f.write(start+'. ' + self.val_map[start] + '\n')
```
## 3-2-1 Step 5

### name

```
**Step 5: Close your newly made file after opening it**
```

### md_content

```
Even though we are coming back to this file to work on it later, it is good practice to always close the file after opening it:
```

### code_snippet

```python
f.close()
```

### md_content

```
Here is the above code fragments shown together:
```

### code_snippet

```python
while stack:
  start = stack.pop()
  f = open("output.txt", "a")
  f.write(start+'. ' +   self.val_map[start] + '\n')
  f.close()
```

### md_content

```
At this point, we have saved the node that we are currently observing into `start`. Once we get this node, we are writing its information to the output file. Think about what more is required for us to do.
