# steps

## 1-2-1 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Open the file and read the contents**
```

### md_content

```
Let's focus on reading in the file.

We have to open and read the file line by line in order to read every folder and its associated number:
```

### code_snippet

```python
readFile = open("textOutline.txt", "r")
for line in readFile:
```

## 1-2-1 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Separate the names from the numbers**
```

### md_content

```
To separate the names from the numbers, we would have to split the line between the number and the words. In order to do that, we can use the built-in `split()` function. We pass in the string `"."` into `split()` because our folder number and name are separated by a period.  However, that still leaves an extra space before the name! For example, if our current line was `0. Friends` and we did `line.split(".")`, we would split the line into `0` and `_Friends`, where the `_`  represents a space before the `F` in `Friends`. We will use the `strip()` function on the folder name to remove this issue. Store these two parts in a list named `dirAndVal` as seen here:
```

### code_snippet

```python
	dirAndVal = line.split(".")
	dirAndVal[1] = dirAndVal[1].strip()
```
