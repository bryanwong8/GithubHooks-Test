**Step 1: Draw the graph**
```

Now that you have `G2, val_map, and pos`, you have all the things you need to draw the graph!

Recall that you can use the `draw()` function from the `networkx` library to actually depict the graph. How do you call it? 

Once you have achieved this, you will have a pictorial representation of the file system! However, you are still going to be missing the labels!

**Step 2: Draw the labels of your nodes for your graph**
```

### md_content

```
Try to remember how to use the `draw_networkx_labels()` function to achieve this! 

Lastly, in order to actually see the graph on your screen, you need to use the `matplotlib` function that **shows** the graph.
