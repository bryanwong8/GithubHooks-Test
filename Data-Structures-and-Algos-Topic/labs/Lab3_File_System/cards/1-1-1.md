## 1-1-1 Step 1

### name

```
**Step 1: Understand the folder structure**
```

### md_content

```
Let's break down the folder structure. In our actual problem, all of the folders will have an associated name, but for now, we are focusing on understanding how the folder **numbers** relate to one another.
* `0` is the root folder
* `01` , `02`, and `03` are all children of the root folder. This can be seen by the **directed** edge starting from the root, going towards `01`, `02`, and `03` respectively.
* `011` , `012`, and `013` are all children of the `01` folder. This can be seen by the **directed** edge starting from `01`, going towards `011`, `012`, and `013` respectively.

Look at the numbering scheme. Do you notice anything interesting?

## 1-1-1 Step 2

### name

```
**Step 2: Notice the parent/child relationship pattern**
```

### md_content

```
You should notice that you can obtain the parent folder number directly from the child  folder number itself!

*  `01`, `02` , and `03` have the root folder (`0`) as its parent, because its first digit is `0`.
*  `011`, `012` , and `013` have folder `01` as its parent, because its first **two** digits are `01`.

Everything except the last digit of a folder tells you the parent folder number!

Check your understanding. Make sure you can answer the following question before moving for:

* What is the number of the parent folder of folder `0121`? Note that this folder is **NOT** in the diagram.
