After creating the `Node `class, we need a `DoublyLinkedList` class that will house all of the functions needed for using the data structure.

First we need to initialize the list using `__init__`.

Remember that every linked list has a **head**, **tail**, and optionally a **size**. 

```python
class DoublyLinkedList:
  
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.size = 0
```

The `head` has a reference to the front or top of the whole list. It points to the first node.

The `tail` has a reference to the back or bottom of the whole list. It points to the last node.

The `size` will keep count of how many nodes there are in the list

- Note that `size` is optional but increases efficiency when needing to measure the size of the list. Instead of iterating through the whole list, we just have to reference `size`.
