As you have already learned, a linked-list consists of a **head** pointer pointing at the first node and a **tail** pointer pointing at the last node of the list. Each node in the list contains the element and two pointers, **next** and **previous**. Note that the head node has a previous pointer that points to null, and the tail node has a next pointer that points to null.

You're to define a Node class that initializes the information of a new node. Here is the actual code:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None
```

This serves as the foundation of the doubly linked-list as **every node** in the list will have **data**, **next**, and **prev**.

The `data` stores that actual value for the node. In the picture above, the value of the `data` in the second node is **B**.

The `next` pointer stores the reference to the *next* node. Node **B**'s `next` has the reference to node **C**.

The `prev` pointer stores the reference to the *previous* node.  Node **B**'s `prev` has a reference to node **A**.
