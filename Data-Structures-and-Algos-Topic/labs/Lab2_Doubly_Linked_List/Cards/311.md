Now, what if we want to search if there's a node in the list?

For this, we would want to create a `search(node)` function that checks if the node is present in the list or not.

```python
def search(self, target): 
    current = self.head 

    # Loop till current not equal to None 
    while current != None: 
      	if current.data == target: 
        	return True # Data found 

      	current = current.next

    return False # Data Not found 
```

The function `search(node)` iterates through each node using `current = current.next`  to get to the next node.

The while loop will break when:

1. the desired node is **found**
2. the current node is `None`, which means you are at the end of the list and the node was **not found**
