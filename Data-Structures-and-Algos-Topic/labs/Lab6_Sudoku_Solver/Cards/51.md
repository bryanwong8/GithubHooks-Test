# nextMove()

Step 1: Initialize boolean variable `boolean` and set to `False`

Following our function header, we will first initialize another local boolean variable called `foundMove` which will be initially set to `False` until we have found a move in one of our three clauses. Thus we will have this:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
```


Step 2: Write a nested loop and iterate through all spots and check if values are unique.

For our first clause, we will start with the easy case which would iterate through all spots to check if there is clearly only one possible value that could replace an empty square. Thus, we will need a nested for-loop that iterates through all possible square (totaling 81). This will look as such:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
      # Implement logic here to find possible move
```


Step 3: Use `findPossible()` to find all possible answers for an empty square

Remember that we will be using our `findPossible()` function to aid us in finding a possible answer for any/every empty square if possible. If we find a move, then you should print the value to be in place for the current square as seen previously such as this example: `(8,9) -> 1  [Only possible]`



As of now our function looks like this:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
  	for r_i in range(0,9):
			for c_i in range(0,9):
      # Implement logic here to find possible move
```

Step 4: Implement remaining logic.

All that's left for this clause is implementing the remaining logic in the case of finding a possible value via `findPossible()` and otherwise, you will output nothing and just move onto clause 2.
