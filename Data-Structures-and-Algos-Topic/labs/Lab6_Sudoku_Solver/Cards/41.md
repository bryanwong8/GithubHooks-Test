# findPossible() Function


As said earlier, `findPossible()` will result in a list of possible valid values for a spot by observing the given spot's row, column, and nonet. 

Step 1: Confirm that the current square we are on is the number '0'. All squares that are empty will hold the value 0. 

Step 2: Build a list called `possible` which will hold values from 0 to 9. As we search through the rows, columns and within the box, we will remove values in `possible` that are found. 


Given that we have `r_i` and `c_i` which is the location of our square, we can use this information to iterate through the same row, column, and box to search for values using a for-loop. 

Step 3: Create loop
  * We will have a total of 4 for-loops. One for-loop to search through all the values in the same row, one for-loop to search through all the values in the same column, and two for-loops to search through all the values within the same box as our square. 


Here are some hints and conditions that you should keep in mind while trying to come up with how to implement this function:

* If a spot is **not** blank, a value has already been placed, and, thus, there is no "possible" values for us to find
  Therefore, we will simply just return an empty list to indicate that there are no possible values for our current square (`r_i`, `c_i`):
* We need to store all possible values and find a way to remove values that are not valid, so that we are only left with possible values
* We are given `r_i` and `c_i`. This is the location of the target square which we can use this information to iterate through the same row, column, and box. For going through the row, column, and box, keep in mind the dimensions of each box and the board as a whole.

The final list `possible` will only contain all POSSIBLE values that our empty square could be replaced with.
