# isValid() Function

Starting off with the function definition accepting the `grid` as an argument, we will have:

```python
def isValid(grid)
```
Step 1: Write two nested for-loops to check rows and columns for repeats.

As we discussed earlier, since we know that we need to check if there are no repeats in any rows or columns within `grid`, we will need two nested for-loops: one to check that all rows contain no repeats and another to check that all columns contain no repeats. We return `True` if no repeats are found.

```python
def isValid(grid)
  for row in grid:
    for i in row:
      # implement logic here to check for repeats in all rows
      
  for c in range(0,9):
    for r in range (0,9):
      # implement logic here to check for repeats in all columns
      
  return True
```



For the first nested for-loop, the outer-loop iterates through each `row` in `grid` :

```python
for row in grid:
```

and then the inner-loop iterates through each element `i`  in  `row`:

```python
for i in row:
```

This is because each of the 9 lists inside of `grid` represents each `row`, and thus you can simply iterate through the elements in a `row` to make comparisons for checking repeated values.


Now notice that for the second nested for-loop, we are iterating through  `range(0,9)`, which is looping from 0 to 9, in both inner and outer loops. This is because we must iterate through each `row` at the same index in order to compare the elements within the same column since our `grid` is a list of rows.

```python
for c in range(0,9):
   for r in range (0,9):
```

For example, if we check all the values for the first column (`c == 0`), we will iterate through the rows (`r`) from `0-9`.

Here's a sample representation of how the rows and columns are within a 3x3 2-D list similar to `grid`:

Step 2: Create empty list to store values read in a row.


For our first nested for-loop, we will define an empty list called `found` within the outer-loop:

```python
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
  for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
```

As we iterate through the elements within a row, we will store the elements into `found` to determine if any of the remaining elements in that row exists in `found` already- which indicates that there is a repeated value in that row. 

```python
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
	for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)
```

Within the inner-loop, we check if `i`, the current element in `row`, exists inside of `found` as stated earlier. If `i` is indeed inside of `found`, then we return False to indicate that there was a repeated value in the row. Otherwise, we append element `i`  into `found` if `i != 0` (because we do not want to care to append blank/empty spaces).



Step 3: Create list to store values read from column


Now moving onto the next nested for-loop to check for repeated values in columns, we will also intialize an empty list `found` for the same reason as implemented above.

```python
	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
  for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
```

Then we will use `i` to assign to `grid[r][c]`  in order to iterate through all the values within each column to  check for repeats. If `i` (the value within a particular column `c`) is not in `found` and does not equal to 0 (a empty space), then we will append the value to `found`.

```python
	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
	for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
			i = grid[r][c]
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	return True
```

At last, we have our final function `isValid()`:

```python
def isValid(grid):
	# Check that all rows contain no repeats
	for row in grid:
		found = []
		for i in row:
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	# Check that all columns contain no repeats
	for c in range(0,9):
		found = []
		for r in range(0,9):
			i = grid[r][c]
			if i in found:
				return False
			if i != 0:
				found.append(i)

	return True
```
