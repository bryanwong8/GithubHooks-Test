# nextMove()

Step 1: Define a variable `possible`

We will simply define a variable `possible` which will be assigned to the function `findPossible()`. Thus, `possible` will be assigned the list of available values for (for our current square) returned from the function:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
```


Step 2: Iterate through each row and column.

Iterating through all rows and columns to cover each square, we are then able to check every single square to see possible values that exist. This case is true if `possible` only contains 1 element because this implies that that is the only value that could fill the current empty square! So we will do the check for if the length of `possible` is equal to 1:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
```

Step 3: Use booleans `foundMove` and `silent`.

If `len(possible) == 1` evaluates to `True`, then we know that a move has been found! Thus we will apply our logic using our booleans `foundMove` and `silent` to print out the result:

```python
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
	# Easy iteration through all spots, checking if clearly only one
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
				if not foundMove:
					if not silent:
						print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(possible[0]) + "  [Only possible]")
					grid[r_i][c_i] = possible[0]
					foundMove = True
```

Step 4: print prompt for the clause and set `foundMove = True`.

Since we know that `len(possible) == 1` then the next if-statement nested inside is `if not foundMove` which will evaluate to `True` if `foundMove` is initially `False`. Following that is another nested if-statement `if not silent` which will evaluate to `True` since `silent` is initialized as `False`. Then all we have left to do is printing the prompt for this clause and then setting `foundMove = True` .
