# isValid() Function


Earlier, we said that `isValid()` will verify that there are no duplicate values in any rows and columns. Thus, in our function, we are going to have to loop through our grid and have conditional logic to handle if there are any repeats in any of the rows or in any of the columns. 

Considering that we are storing our grid as a 2-D list that contains 9 lists with 9 elements in each list, our nested for loop structure for going through the rows will be slightly different than the loop structure for going through the columns. Remember that each element of the 2D list is a list that represents a row of the grid!

If we find a repeat in the grid, we will return `False`. If both nested for-loops iterate through the grid successfully, then the grid is deemed valid so return `True`.

Starting off with the function definition which accepts the `grid` as an argument, we will have:

```python
def isValid(grid)
``` 

Step 1: Create two nested for-loops

one to check that all rows contain no repeats and another to check that the elements contain no repeats. If both nested for-loops iterate through the grid successfully, then the grid is deemed valid so return True.
