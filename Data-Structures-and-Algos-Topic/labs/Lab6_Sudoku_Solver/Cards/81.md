# main() Part 1

Step 1: Create a temporary `tempGrid`.

When checking for user input error, you should create a temporary grid `tempGrid`. This should be used to ensure that the entered grid is valid before we start the game.

Step 2: Store the data in a string

For actually taking in the user input, we should store the data in a string. If the input (which we stored in the string initially) is invalid, we should output the approriate messages as specified earlier:

- If there was not a total of 81 characters, the user will be prompted: 

  - `"Not 81 characters."`

  Step 3: Verify if string is 81 characters.
  
  Given that you know that we will store the user input in a string, how can we check the above condition?

  Once you verify that the input string is 81 characters, you should find a way to transfer the data to `tempGrid`. 

- If the Sudoku board is invalid, the user will be prompted:

  - `"Invalid grid."`

  Remember that a Sudoku board is valid when there are no duplicate values in any rows and columns. Sound familiar?
