# printGrid()

Step 4: We are almost done, all thats left to do is to form the grid. We can accomplish this using simple print statements.


Here is how you should start the function:

```python
def printGrid(grid):
  for row_index,row in enumerate(grid):
    rowString = ""
    # do formatting here
    for index,element in enumerate(row):
      # do formatting here
    print(rowString)
```

> Note: we use `enumerate()` instead of `range()` because it allows us to iterate through our grid using a **tuple**, where one variable represents the index and another variable represents the value at that index.

In the first for-loop,`row_index` will be used to iterate through the rows (`row`) in our `grid`. In the second for-loop, `index` will be used to iterate through each `row` and `element` corresponds to the value at `index`.

Within each for-loop, all that's left is a series of if/if-else statements with logic that will be used to format the Sudoku board to be printed. At the end of each `row` we generate, we then print `rowString` to progressively print out our board row by row.


Within our first for-loop, we are iterating through the rows (`row`) via `row_index` in our `grid`, thus we will need to append `"------|-------|-------"` for every three rows to format our row quadrants which is accomplished via this if-statement:

```python
if row_index % 3 == 0 and row_index != 0:
  print("------|-------|-------") 
```

Then for our second for-loop, we are iterating through the values (`element`) in each `row` via `index` which requires us to store the `element` into `rowString`, replaces zeros with underscores `"_"` and appending the pipe `"|"` for every 3 values:

```python
		for index,element in enumerate(row):
			if index % 3 == 0 and index != 0:
				rowString += "| "
			if element == 0:
				rowString += "_ "
			else:
				rowString += str(element) + " "
```

In the end, our final `printGrid()` function will then look like this!

```python
# Prints out a formatted version of the current grid
def printGrid(grid):
	for row_index,row in enumerate(grid):
		rowString = ""
		if row_index % 3 == 0 and row_index != 0:
			print("------|-------|-------")
		for index,element in enumerate(row):
			if index % 3 == 0 and index != 0:
				rowString += "| "
			if element == 0:
				rowString += "_ "
			else:
				rowString += str(element) + " "
		print(rowString)
```
