# main() Part 2

![](https://cdn.livesudoku.com/artwork/singlesudoku-center.png)

After the user has successfully inputted a valid `grid`, we need to provide controls to the user with the possible options that they can use as their Sudoku board is going through the solving process. The UI for the controls will be prompted to the user as shown below:

```python
Controls:
	'Enter': Display the next move
	'p': Print the current grid (small)
	'c': Complete the grid (or attempt to)
  '(r,c)': Prints the possible options for that row, column
```

Controls:

- If the user pressed `Enter`: it will print the next move that occurred (solving one square in the Sudoku board).
- If the user pressed `p`: it will print the entire grid in the state that it currently is in.
- If the user pressed `c`: it will complete the entire grid and print the final, finished Sudoku board if possible.
- If the user enters in a row, column pair `(r, c)`: it will print the possible options of values for that row, column pair (square).

Depending on whatever the user inputted, we must take that input and call the appropriate function to handle their request. So you must check the what the user inputted in order to drive what operation you will be performing. 

Additionally, we will be using a timer in the case that the user enters `c` because we will be providing the user what time it takes to solve their Sudoku board. The timer is a simple implementation that will be handled using the **`time()`** function.
