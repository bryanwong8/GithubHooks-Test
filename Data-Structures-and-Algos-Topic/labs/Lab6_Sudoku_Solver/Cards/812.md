# main() Part 1

Now that we know we have a total of 81 characters, we need to verify is this is even a valid Sudoku board. To do so we need to create the structure of our board which will be stored into `tempGrid`. Remember that programmatically, our Sudoku board is a list of of 9 lists where each list contains 9 elements (numbers). 

Step 1: Define an empty list called `r` and fill up each list with 9 elements at a time and append it to `tempGrid` such that `r` will be appended to `tempGrid` 9 times to get our entire Sudoku board:

```python
		else:
			for row in range(0,9):
				r = []
				for col in range(0,9):
					r.append(int(data[row*9+col]))
				tempGrid.append(r)
```

> Note: remember that the user input (stored in `data`) is a string, so we must type cast it to an int

Step 2: Now that `data` is formatted into a 9x9 grid that was stored into `tempGrid` 
we can now verify if the user's inputted grid is valid by using our `isValid()` function. If `isValid()` returns True, we simply can do the assignment `grid = tempGrid`. Else, if `isValid()` returns False, we will print `"Invalid grid."` and reset `data` but assigning it as an empty string:

```python
			if not isValid(tempGrid):
				data = ""
				print("Invalid grid.")
				printGrid(tempGrid)


	grid = tempGrid
```

Thus, we have finished the first part of our UI for accepting the first user input from the user as seen below:

```python
# The UI, with options for entering grids, finding next moves, printing the current grid, finishing the grid, and printing out
# possible values for a row and column index
if len(grid) == 0:
	tempGrid = []

	data = ""
	while len(data) != 81:
		tempGrid = []
		data = input("Type in the grid, going left to right row by row, 0 = empty: ")
		if len(data) != 81:
			print("Not 81 characters.")
		else:
			for row in range(0,9):
				r = []
				for col in range(0,9):
					r.append(int(data[row*9+col]))
				tempGrid.append(r)
			if not isValid(tempGrid):
				data = ""
				print("Invalid grid.")
				printGrid(tempGrid)


	grid = tempGrid
```
