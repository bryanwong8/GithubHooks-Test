# nextMove()

Now for our third clause for our `nextMove()` function, we will be checking every single square within our `grid` similarly to our first clause. However, this clause is our fallback in which we will be using in conjunction with another function called `testPossible()` which we have yet defined. 

With that in mind, I will further provide hints for this guessing clause in our `nextMove()` function:

- One nested for-loop to iterate through all squares.

- Using the resulting list return from `findPossible()`, you will need to use a for-loop to iterate through each index in that resulting list and applying further logic to check including `testPossible()`

- The `testPossible()` function accepts 6 arguments:

  - `grid`
  - `r_i`
  - `c_i`
  - `i`
  - `depth + 1`
  - `finish`
