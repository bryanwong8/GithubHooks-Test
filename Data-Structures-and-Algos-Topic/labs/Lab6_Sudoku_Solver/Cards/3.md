# Working Within a Box

For the game Sudoku, we must make sure that within each box, there is no repeats. This means that the numbers 1-9 should only appear once within each box. A single box is represented in this picture below:

We will write the function `box()` which determines all the elements that are not currently within a box. 


This function will take in 3 arguments:

* the grid (`grid`)

* row index (`r_i`) 

* column index (`c_i`)

Keep in mind that there are a total of 9 elements within a box that is formatted in a 3x3 structure. `box()` should return a list that will contain all the numbers (anywhere from 1-9) that do **not** already exist in a particular box.

For example, the function header for `box()` will be:

```python
def box(grid, r_i, c_i):
```

Considering a box contains the elements 1, 3, 9, 4, and 5; then a sample list returned from `box()` would look like:

```python
elements = [2, 6, 7, 8]
```
