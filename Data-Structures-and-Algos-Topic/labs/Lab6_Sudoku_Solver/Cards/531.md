# nextMove()

Step 1: Check for `not foundMove` and `depth < 2` 
First we must check for `not foundMove` and `depth < 2` since these conditions must be satisfied in order to apply our guessing clause:

```python
if not foundMove and depth < 2:
```

Step 2: Iterate through every square.

If the above condition is true, then we will now iterate through every single square by using a nested for-loop. Then we must check if `not foundMove` for every iteration:

```python
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			if not foundMove:
```

Within this nested for-loop, we will be using our two functions in conjunction with each other which are `findPossible()` and `testPossible()`. First we will use an empty list `possible` which will be defined as the list returned from `findPossible()`:

```python
				possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
```

Step 3: Iterate through all the values within `possible`.

Given the list `possible`, we will now iterate through all the values within that list. Through each value we iterate to, we will check if `not foundMove` and `testPossible(grid, r_i, c_i, i, depth+1, finish)` which will determine that we have found a result via guessing and checking:

```python
				for i in possible:
					if not foundMove and testPossible(grid,r_i,c_i,i,depth+1,finish):
```

Step 4: Check `not silent` in order to print next move using the guess and check method

If the above condition evaluates to `True`, we can check if `not silent` in order to allow us to print our next move via guess and check method. 

Step 5: Assign value `i` from possible.

Then we can simply assign the value `i` from `possible` (that succeeded through our if-statements) to our `grid` at location of the square `[r_i][c_i]`:

```python
						if not silent:
							print(depth)
							print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(i) + "  [Guessing and checking]")
						grid[r_i][c_i] = i
						foundMove = True
```



Finally, we have our last clause fully defined and it will look like below:

```python
# Guessing clause (not a very pretty fallback)
if not foundMove and depth < 2:
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			if not foundMove:
				possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
				for i in possible:
					if not foundMove and testPossible(grid,r_i,c_i,i,depth+1,finish):
						if not silent:
							print(depth)
							print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(i) + "  [Guessing and checking]")
						grid[r_i][c_i] = i
						foundMove = True
```





In the end, our finished `nextMove()` function will look like this:

```python
# This attempts to find the/a next move
# Silent determines if it prints out the move it makes (not done for 'complete')
# Depth determines if it's allowed to try guessing (if depth < 3)
# Finish if it should be allowed to make any move possible (complete)
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
	# Easy iteration through all spots, checking if clearly only one
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
				if not foundMove:
					if not silent:
						print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(possible[0]) + "  [Only possible]")
					grid[r_i][c_i] = possible[0]
					foundMove = True

	# Check by number
	if not foundMove:
		for n in range(1,10):
			# Check by row
			if not foundMove:
				for r_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for c_i in range(0,9):
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in row]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True

			# Check by column
			if not foundMove:
				for c_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for r_i in range(0,9):
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in column]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True

			# Check by box
			if not foundMove:
				for b_r in range(0,3):
					for b_c in range(0,3):
						b = box(grid,b_r,b_c)
						if n in b:
							m = []
							for r in range(b_r*3,b_r*3+3):
								for c in range(b_c*3,b_c*3+3):
									if n in findPossible(r,c,grid):
										m.append((r,c))
							if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
								if not silent:
									print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in box]")
								grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
								foundMove = True

	# Guessing clause (not a very pretty fallback)
	if not foundMove and depth < 2:
		for r_i in range(0,9):
			for c_i in range(0,9):
				if not foundMove:
					possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
					for i in possible:
						if not foundMove and testPossible(grid,r_i,c_i,i,depth+1,finish):
							if not silent:
								print(depth)
								print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(i) + "  [Guessing and checking]")
							grid[r_i][c_i] = i
							foundMove = True

	return foundMove
