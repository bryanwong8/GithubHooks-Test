# complete()

Step 3: Check if there are moves 

Since our `complete()` function is continually calling `nextMove()` until it gets stuck or succeeds, we should check if our `grid` still has moves. Hence, we will keep this logic in a while loop:

```python
def complete(grid,depth=0):
    moved = True
  	while hasMoves(grid) and moved:
      # Implement logic here to determine the state of moved
```

`moved` will be a boolean initialized to True and will only be set False once a move has not been found...
