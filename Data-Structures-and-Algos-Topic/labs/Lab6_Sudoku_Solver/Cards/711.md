# testPossible()

Step 1: Duplicate `grid`.

We first need to duplicate our `grid` to preserve the original `grid` since we are modifying the duplicate by storing the value `n` at the square (`r`,`c`):

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	# start function by writing code to create duplicate
```

Note that in order to achieve this, we will have to use the function `copy.deepcopy()` and, so, we must import the Python library `copy`.
