# complete()

Now that we have all the necessary logic for solving our Sudoku board we will write the functions `hasMoves()` and `complete()`.

Step 1: Create function `hasMoves()`

We will start off with `hasMoves()` first since `complete()` is dependent on it. `hasMoves()` is a very simple function that checks if the `grid` is finished (all empty squares are filled) and thus indicating that the Sudoku board has been solved. The function header for `hasMoves()` is defined as such:

```python
def hasMoves(grid):
```

> Hint: `hasMoves()` is a one line function!



Step 2: Create function `complete()`

Then for our `complete()` function, it will attempt to complete the `grid` by continually calling `nextMove()` until it gets stuck or succeeds. The function header for `complete()` is defined as such:


```python
def complete(grid,depth=0):
```

> Hint: `complete()` uses the functions `hasMoves()` and `nextMove()`
