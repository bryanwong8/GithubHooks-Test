# nextMove()

Step 1: Use `findPossible(r_i, c_i, grid)`.

Working through the first condition of checking by row, we will use `findPossible(r_i, c_i, grid)` to determine if our current number `n` exists within it. If yes, then we will append the square we checked (`r_i`, `c_i`) into our list `m`:

```python
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
```

Step 2: Check if the length of `m` is equal to 1

Then we will check if the length of `m` is equal to 1 because this tells us that our current number `n` is the only value that can be placed in our empty square which was stored in `m`. 


Step 3: Confirm if `foundMove` is `not False`

We also must confirm that `foundMove` is still `not False` (which is the same as True) since we have not just found our first next move to be done:

```python
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
```

Step 4: Check `if not silent`

If the above is evaluated `True`, then we will check `if not silent:` in order for us to then print the prompt that we have made our next move and what that move was.


Step 5: Assign `n` to the empty square in `m`.

 Then we just need to assign the current number `n` to the empty square in `m` within our `grid` and set `foundMove` to `True`: 

```python
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in row]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True
```

Overall, our final first condition (check by row) in our check number clause will look like such all together:

```python
			# Check by row
			if not foundMove:
				for r_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for c_i in range(0,9):
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in row]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True
```



The next condition in our check by row clause, check by column, will be implemented the same exact way as above except for simply just flipping the for-loops! Then all we need to change the print statement since we found this by checking in column. Therefore, the final second condition for this clause will look like such:

```python
			# Check by column
			if not foundMove:
				for c_i in range(0,9): # only difference 
					m = []
					for r_i in range(0,9): # is flipping these for-loops
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in column]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True
```



For our last condition in our check number clause, we have check by box. Within our first nested for-loop, we have to check if the current number `n` is available to be placed in any box within our grid. Thus we will do so using `box()` like this:

```python
			if not foundMove:
				for b_r in range(0,3):
					for b_c in range(0,3):
						b = box(grid,b_r,b_c)
```

After we will check if the current number `n` exists in `b`:

```python
						if n in b:
```

If so, we will continue on to check for the row, column pair (`r`, `c`) within the same box that (`r_i`,` c_i`) is within to be appended to our list `m` if the current number `n` exists from the list returned from `findPossible()`:

```python
			if not foundMove:
				for b_r in range(0,3):
					for b_c in range(0,3):
						b = box(grid,b_r,b_c)
						if n in b:
							m = []
							for r in range(b_r*3,b_r*3+3):
								for c in range(b_c*3,b_c*3+3):
									if n in findPossible(r,c,grid):
										m.append((r,c))
```

Following our second nested for-loop, the remaining definition of this check by box condition will be identical to the previous conditions such that we confirm if `len(m) == 1` and `not foundMove`. If this evaluates to `True`, then we check if `not silent` and then print the appropriate prompt of our next move via check by box method. Then we assign the location in our `grid` stored within `m`  to the current number `n`. Lastly we just set `foundMove` to `True`.

```python
			# Check by box
			if not foundMove:
				for b_r in range(0,3):
					for b_c in range(0,3):
						b = box(grid,b_r,b_c)
						if n in b:
							m = []
							for r in range(b_r*3,b_r*3+3):
								for c in range(b_c*3,b_c*3+3):
									if n in findPossible(r,c,grid):
										m.append((r,c))
							if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
								if not silent:
									print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in `]")
								grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
								foundMove = True
```





Up to now, we have fully defined the first two clauses of our function `nextMove()`. It will look like this:

```python
# This attempts to find the/a next move
# Silent determines if it prints out the move it makes (not done for 'complete')
# Depth determines if it's allowed to try guessing (if depth < 3)
# Finish if it should be allowed to make any move possible (complete)
def nextMove(grid,silent=False,depth=0,finish=False):
	foundMove = False
	# Easy iteration through all spots, checking if clearly only one
	for r_i in range(0,9):
		for c_i in range(0,9):
			possible = findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid)
			if len(possible) == 1:
				if not foundMove:
					if not silent:
						print("(" + str(r_i+1) + "," + str(c_i+1) + ") -> " + str(possible[0]) + "  [Only possible]")
					grid[r_i][c_i] = possible[0]
					foundMove = True

	# Check by number
	if not foundMove:
		for n in range(1,10):
			# Check by row
			if not foundMove:
				for r_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for c_i in range(0,9):
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in row]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True

			# Check by column
			if not foundMove:
				for c_i in range(0,9):
					m = []
					for r_i in range(0,9):
						if n in findPossible(r_i,c_i,grid):
							m.append((r_i,c_i))
					if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
						if not silent:
							print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in column]")
						grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
						foundMove = True

			# Check by box
			if not foundMove:
				for b_r in range(0,3):
					for b_c in range(0,3):
						b = box(grid,b_r,b_c)
						if n in b:
							m = []
							for r in range(b_r*3,b_r*3+3):
								for c in range(b_c*3,b_c*3+3):
									if n in findPossible(r,c,grid):
										m.append((r,c))
							if len(m) == 1 and not foundMove:
								if not silent:
									print("(" + str(m[0][0]+1) + "," + str(m[0][1]+1) + ") -> " + str(n) + "  [Only in `]")
								grid[m[0][0]][m[0][1]] = n
								foundMove = True
                
                
	# Guessing clause
```

Now all we have left is to implement our guessing clause and our `nextMove()` function is done!
