 # complete()

 `hasMoves()` is a simple function that will basically return a boolean (True or False) by determining if there are any 0's in `grid`. This indicates whether or not the Sudoku board has any remaining moves or if it's done. 

 If there are any 0's in a `row` for all the rows in `grid`, then return True. Otherwise return False, which indicates that the `grid` is complete.

Since our `complete()` function is continually calling `nextMove()` until it gets stuck or succeeds, we should check if our `grid` still has moves. 

 `moved` will be a boolean initialized to True and will only be set False once a move has not been found...
